## Graph Analysis Performance

`bv` computes 9 graph-theoretic metrics on startup. Their computational complexity varies significantly:

| Metric | Complexity | 100 nodes | 500 nodes | 1000 nodes | 2000 nodes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Degree | O(V) | <1ms | <1ms | <5ms | <10ms |
| TopologicalSort | O(V+E) | <1ms | <5ms | <5ms | <10ms |
| Critical Path | O(V+E) | <1ms | <5ms | <5ms | <10ms |
| PageRank | O(iter×E) | <5ms | ~20ms | ~40ms | ~100ms |
| Eigenvector | O(iter×E) | <5ms | ~15ms | ~30ms | ~70ms |
| HITS | O(iter×E) | <5ms | ~5ms | ~10ms | ~30ms |
| **Betweenness** | **O(V×E)** | ~10ms | ~300ms | **~1.3s** | **~4.6s** |
| **Cycles** | O((V+E)×C) | varies | varies | varies | varies |

**Key Insight:** Betweenness centrality and cycle detection are the primary performance bottlenecks for large graphs.

## Two-Phase Startup Architecture

`bv` uses a two-phase startup to ensure responsive UI:

### Phase 1: Instant (<50ms)
Computes metrics needed for initial render:
- Degree centrality (blocking indicators)
- Topological sort (execution order)
- Basic stats (counts, density)

**Result:** You see the issue list immediately.

### Phase 2: Background (async)
Computes expensive metrics in a background goroutine:
- PageRank
- Betweenness (with timeout)
- Eigenvector
- HITS
- Cycle detection
- Critical path scoring

**Result:** Insights dashboard shows "Computing..." until Phase 2 completes.

## Factors Affecting Performance

### 1. Graph Size (Node Count)
- Linear algorithms (degree, topo sort) scale with V+E
- Betweenness scales quadratically: O(V×E)
- For 2000+ nodes, betweenness can take 5+ seconds

### 2. Graph Density
```
density = edges / (nodes × (nodes - 1))
```

| Density | Classification | Impact |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| <0.01 | Sparse | Fast - most real projects |
| 0.01-0.05 | Normal | Standard performance |
| 0.05-0.15 | Dense | Betweenness may timeout |
| >0.15 | Very Dense | Consider simplifying deps |

### 3. Cycle Structure
Cycle detection uses Johnson's algorithm which enumerates ALL elementary cycles:
- **Acyclic graphs:** Fast (SCC pre-check returns immediately)
- **Few cycles:** Fast
- **Many overlapping cycles:** Can be exponential
- **Complete graph:** O((n-1)!) cycles - pathological case

A complete graph with 20 nodes has 19! ≈ 10^17 cycles. This is why cycle detection has strict timeouts.

## Size-Based Algorithm Selection

`bv` automatically adjusts algorithm selection based on graph size:

### Small Graphs (<100 nodes)
- All metrics computed with **exact algorithms**
- Generous timeouts (2 seconds)
- Full cycle enumeration (up to 1000)

### Medium Graphs (100-500 nodes)
- All metrics computed with **exact algorithms**
- Standard timeouts (500ms)
- Cycle limit: 100

### Large Graphs (500-2000 nodes)
- **Approximate betweenness** for sparse graphs (density < 0.01)
- Betweenness skipped for dense graphs
- Shorter timeouts (200-300ms)
- Cycle limit: 50

### XL Graphs (>2000 nodes)
- **Approximate betweenness** (sampling-based)
- Cycle detection skipped
- HITS skipped if density > 0.001
- Minimal timeouts

## Sampling-Based Betweenness Approximation

For large graphs (500+ nodes), `bv` uses a sampling-based approximation of betweenness centrality instead of the exact O(V×E) algorithm:

### How It Works
Instead of computing shortest paths from ALL nodes, we sample k pivot nodes and extrapolate:
1. Randomly select k pivot nodes
2. Compute betweenness contribution from each pivot
3. Scale up by (n/k) to estimate full betweenness

### Error Bounds
| Sample Size | Approximate Error |
|-------------|-------------------|
| k=50 | ~14% |
| k=100 | ~10% |
| k=200 | ~7% |

### Default Sample Sizes
| Graph Size | Sample Size |
|------------|-------------|
| <100 nodes | Exact (use full algorithm) |
| 100-500 nodes | min(50, 20% of nodes) |
| 500-2000 nodes | 100 |
| >2000 nodes | 200 |

### Performance Improvement
For a 1000-node graph:
- Exact: ~1.3 seconds
- Approximate (k=100): ~130ms (**10x faster**)

The approximation is sufficient for ranking purposes (identifying which nodes are most central) while dramatically improving startup time.

## CLI Flags for Performance

### Diagnostic Flags

```bash
# Show detailed startup timing breakdown
bv --profile-startup

# Machine-readable timing (JSON)
bv --profile-startup --profile-json
```

**Sample `--profile-startup` output:**
```
Startup Profile for /path/to/.beads/beads.jsonl
================================================
Data: 847 issues, 2341 dependencies, density=0.003

Phase 1 (blocking):
  Build graph:     12ms
  Degree:           3ms
  TopoSort:         5ms
  Total Phase 1:   20ms

Phase 2 (async):
  PageRank:        45ms
  Betweenness:    312ms (timeout: NO)
  Eigenvector:     28ms
  HITS:            19ms
  Cycles:          67ms (found: 3)
  Critical Path:   11ms
  Total Phase 2:  482ms

Total startup:    502ms

Recommendations:
  ✓ Startup within acceptable range (<1s)
  ⚠ Betweenness taking 60% of Phase 2 time
    Consider: --force-full-analysis only when needed
```

### Performance Control Flags

```bash
# Force compute ALL metrics regardless of graph size
# (May be slow for large graphs - use sparingly)
bv --force-full-analysis
```

## Troubleshooting Slow Startup

### Remote Dolt latency

B9s treats opening and querying the selected source as its validation step. A
separate `COUNT(*)` preflight would add a connection and two or more network
round trips without proving anything that the real load does not immediately
prove.

The Dolt reader loads issues with one query, then loads labels, dependencies,
and comments with three batch queries. On a remote server, connection setup and
those query boundaries set the latency floor. Use `B9S_DEBUG=1 b9s` to see the
connection, issue scan, relation batches, and final result timestamps.

Project discovery is a separate filesystem cost. Keep `max_depth` inside the
`discovery` mapping so the configured limit takes effect:

```yaml
discovery:
  scan_paths:
    - ~/Documents
  max_depth: 2
```

A root-level `max_depth` key is ignored, which causes B9s to use the default
depth of 3.

### Step 1: Profile Startup
```bash
bv --profile-startup
```

Identify which phase/metric is slow.

### Step 2: Check Graph Size
```bash
bv --robot-insights | jq '.stats | {nodeCount, edgeCount, density}'
```

For large graphs (>500 nodes), some metrics are automatically skipped.

### Step 3: Check for Cycles
```bash
bv --robot-insights | jq '.cycles'
```

Many cycles can cause slowdowns even with timeouts due to memory pressure.

### Step 4: Try Without Problem Metrics

If betweenness is the bottleneck:
- Check if your graph is >500 nodes - it should auto-skip
- If not, consider if you need betweenness metrics

If cycles are the bottleneck:
- Review your dependencies for circular patterns
- Use `bd` to break cycles: `bd unblock A --from B`

### Step 5: Report Issues

If startup is slow and profiling shows unexpected behavior:
```bash
bv --profile-startup --profile-json > profile.json
```

Include `profile.json` in your bug report.

## Performance Targets

| Graph Size | Target Startup |
|------------|----------------|
| <100 nodes | <100ms |
| 100-500 nodes | <300ms |
| 500-1000 nodes | <500ms |
| 1000-2000 nodes | <1s |
| >2000 nodes | <2s |

These targets assume Phase 1 (blocking) startup. Phase 2 completes asynchronously.

## Best Practices

### For Project Maintainers

1. **Keep dependency graphs sparse**
   - Only create blocking dependencies where truly needed
   - Use `related` type for informational links

2. **Avoid circular dependencies**
   - Cycles indicate design issues
   - Break cycles before they accumulate

3. **Monitor graph density**
   - Healthy: <0.05
   - Warning: >0.15

### For AI Agents

1. **Use robot flags for programmatic access**
   - `--robot-insights` for metrics
   - `--robot-plan` for actionable items

2. **Check for timeouts in robot output**
   - Timeout flags indicate metrics may be incomplete
   - Design agents to handle partial data gracefully

3. **For large repositories**
   - Use `--robot-plan` for immediate actionable items
   - Avoid forcing full analysis unless needed

## Timeout Configuration

All expensive algorithms have configurable timeouts:

| Algorithm | Default Timeout | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Betweenness | 500ms | O(V×E) can be seconds |
| PageRank | 500ms | Usually fast, defensive |
| HITS | 500ms | Usually fast, defensive |
| Cycle Detection | 500ms | Can be exponential |

When a timeout triggers:
- The metric is skipped or returns partial results
- A warning appears in the profile output
- The UI marks the metric as unavailable

## Advanced: Memory Considerations

For very large graphs:

1. **Cycle enumeration** is memory-hungry
   - Each cycle stores full path
   - Limited to `MaxCyclesToStore` (default: 100)

2. **Graph structure** uses gonum's sparse representation
   - Efficient for sparse graphs
   - ~100 bytes per node + ~50 bytes per edge

3. **Typical memory usage**
   - 1000 issues, 3000 deps: ~5MB
   - 5000 issues, 15000 deps: ~25MB
   - 10000 issues, 30000 deps: ~50MB

## Benchmarking

Run the benchmark suite to measure performance on your hardware:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
./scripts/benchmark.sh

# Save baseline
./scripts/benchmark.sh baseline

# Compare after changes
./scripts/benchmark.sh compare

# Quick benchmarks (CI mode)
./scripts/benchmark.sh quick
```

See `benchmarks/` directory for detailed results.
